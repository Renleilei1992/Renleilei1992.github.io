                time was successfully shortened from <strong>20</strong> to <strong>5</strong> hours, Experienced a great deal of testing
                and optimization, I have written a large number of scripts( <strong>Shell</strong> ), <strong>Optimize</strong> a large number

                Through this design and migration experience, I studied a lot about the Linux/AIX/Unix system and database like informix/DB2 etc.
                Meanwhile, this experience taught me that scripts( <strong>Shell</strong> ) is Efficient, the bank have a huge amount of data, huge
                server clusters are needed, and a new project be on-line should repeat several large-scale tests like UAT、Pre-production、Production

            <h2>The bank IT system is undergoing great updating</h2>
            <p>In China, the Alipay and Wechat-payment is developing rapidly, if banks are staying where it is and do not make any progress,
               the payment method will change dramatically, the People will put money into the E-banking.

               So, bank need to catch up with the Alipay and Wechat-payment, with Huge investment. :)

                This project was a long-term one that started in 2013, as one of the core businesses of DM
                Group. Because the designer who was responsible for this migration project only 4, I was
                the Main force in this group. I had to understand all background information of this
                project very quickly. Also, based on the current design, I needed to develop the on-line steps
                avoid data confusion.

            <p class="strong">
                Because one of my design principle is less is more, I set the goal of my new design as
                easy-understanding,

            <h2>Find users' pain points and detect acceptable resolutions</h2>
            <p>Since it’s a back-end product whose clients are companies, not like to-customers product, I needed to
                specify what features clients really want. Also, I needed to do research on WeChat APIs to
                figure out what technical solutions they provide, and what technical restrictions they set.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-ta.png" alt="Technology architecture">
            </div>
            <p>Through discussions with my boss and director, I defined the 3 main reasons why businesses had to buy our
                product:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>Boosting their products sale.
                </li>
                <li>Helping them better understand their users.
                </li>
                <li>Enhancing the popularity of their marketing campaign.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Next step was to defined how we could help them achieve these goals through WeChat account CMS. WeChat
                business account had a main function of sending certain types of messages to your users 4 times in a
                month, such as article, sound, and video. After a productive meeting, our team determined to take this
                function as the starting point and breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>How could we best use the limited 4-time sending opportunity? The idea was that we tried to define
                the category of each user and to segment them into specified groups. Later, it allowed clients to send
                specified messages to each group, which greatly increased the utility of each message.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-sending.png" alt="Articles sending optimization">
            </div>
            <p>
                Later, to help clients send multiple messages more efficiently, we proposed scheduling message sending
                function, which allowed users to determine sending time in advance and the message would then be sent
                automatically. Besides, how could we boost their products sale? We believed that there should be a
                connection between business’ online service and offline service. That’s how we proposed the idea of
                Points of Interests (POI). Based on users’ locations or clients’ requirements, users can access their
                offline interested points by using WeChat online navigation.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-poi-scenario.png" alt="Two POI scenarios">
            </div>
            <p>What’s more, how could we help users to more easily access marketing information? In another words, how
                could we make users more easier to get access to marketing information? We decided to use QR code as the
                media because in China, everyone knows how to scan QR codes. Therefore, we designed the function called QR
                campaign — connecting campaign with QR code. Last, to help clients better understand their users, we
                redesigned the analytics module to provide detailed data for clients to analyze.</p>

            <h2>Rapid iteration helps the team understand what the client really wants</h2>
            <p>I used Axure to build prototype and interaction effects. Here was the information architecture of the
                CMS:</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-ia.png" alt="Information architecture">
            </div>
            <p>
                The index page of the online platform was the dashboard page. What we wanted to do here was to make
                clients get a quick feedback of their accounts’ live feed. The dashboard was the central admin panel
                where administrator can access the different data collected by CMS, such as the total number of
                followers, the broadcast views of groups, or the ranks of QR campaign. By the way, clients can customize
                the dashboard page based on their hobbies.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard">
            </div>
            <p>
                As I described above, tags were the bridge connecting articles and users. Clients could track the
                interest of followers by adding tags to published contents. Therefore, followers' behaviour can be
                defined by their actions with contents, such as view, like and share.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-tag.png" alt="Tag management">
            </div>
            <p>
                Besides using tags to define followers, group segmentation also supported many other attributes to
                create groups, such as gender, age, region, language, following time, active time, and QR campaign
                labels. We didn’t add QR campaign labels as an attribute at first, however, when we reviewed
                the draft wireframe, we thought it was a good idea to build more relationships among platform’s modules,
                providing clients more options.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-group.png" alt="Group segmentation">
            </div>
            <p>
                Targeted broadcast scheduling allowed clients to send customized news to certain groups. Also, it supported
                schedule broadcasts ahead of time, which was a very demanding function for many businesses based on our
                survey. Supposed your business would like to send morning news to users each day at 6 a.m., which was
                difficult to manually achieve without errors everyday. Now, this function relieves all your pains.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>By using POI finders, clients could set interesting places around followers in two interaction modes. One
                was that followers could get a POI list by sending their location to CMS back-end. Moreover, given the
                fact that WeChat accounts supported embedded HTML5 websites, we designed a more friendly usage situation —
                followers could jump to a customized POI H5 website by tabbing a menu item.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-poi.png" alt="POI finder">
            </div>
            <p>By creating a QR campaign, a QR code would be generated automatically attached to the campaign. Then
                clients could track users who scanned the QR code to analyze their behaviors. Besides, the Analytics
                module could calculate the total scanning number of each campaign, so clients could know each campaign’s
                performance.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-campaign.png" alt="QR campaign">

            <p class="strong">Through one and a half months of research and experimentation, the boss finally
                enthusiastically passed our design proposition.</p>

            <h2>Explore more usage scenarios and make your design fit all of them.</h2>
            <p>
                My director was an experienced designer and I learned some of his thinking modes when I worked with
                him. First, he tried to make the design satisfy business goals. We have to design something which
                can be sold, which is how we make a living. Therefore, you need to specify usage scenarios of
                how each person uses your product.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, after you come up with one scenario and design your solution for it, don’t stop. Keep
                looking for potential scenarios. Brainstorm all kinds of possible conditions without thinking technical
                restrictions first — the diverging phase. Later, you can narrow your ideas after balancing restrictions
                — the converging phase. Last, make sure your design fits all scenarios to make everyone happy.
